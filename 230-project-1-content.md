# Reflract
## I. High Concept
  *Reflract* is a simple 2D puzzle game. The game will simulate small interactable environments in which most would contain at least one ray of light. The player must interact with the environment to guide the light towards a specific part of the environment in order to complete the level and advance. This is meant to be a small, quick experience for people to enjoy.
## II. Genre
  The main genre is puzzle, since the game's objective can only be completed by solving puzzles simulated into the environment. The game can also be described as casual and relaxing.
## III. Platform
  *Reflract* is originally planned for desktop, but could be turned into mobile-friendly rather easily.
## IV. Story
  There is no main story to the game. However, the player's motive for completing the puzzles is that they are rewarded with an appealing scene as the light illuminates the entire environment, possibly accompanied a short music piece as well.
## V. Aesthetics
  ### Graphics
  The graphics style would be somewhat cartoonish as it would go for a more simplified and minimilistic look. The game is not built to be appealing to look at for hours, but it should bring some sort of simple beauty in the short time that it is played.
  ### Sound
  Most interactable elements in the environment will trigger sound effects according to the object. There will be soft ambient music while the player is trying to complete the level. Once the level is completed, a short theme will play in correspondence to that level as a reward for the player.
## VI. Gameplay
  ### Mechanics
  The player can only interact with certain objects in the scene by clicking on them. The actions vary for what occurs depending on the object. For example, a rotating mirror can be turned when the player clicks on it.
  ### Controls
  All the controls in the game will be handled by only clicking/touching.
  ### Teaching the Game
  The first level will act as a tutorial level. The player isn't directly told what to do through instructions, but instead is taught to click on objects to explore what they are able to interact with. Most interactable objects in the first level will be standing out from the environment. In the case that the player hasn't figured out what to do within a minute by not interacting with anything, an arrow will appear that will point to the object that they would need to interact with. After the tutorial is over, the player can earn hints by secret discovering interactable objects in the levels. When a hint is activated, the green arrow will point the way for the next interactable object, much like in the tutorial level.
  ### Player Learning
  The player would need to learn how to find interactable objects easily and think through whether the action would help achieve their goal. Some objects may backtrack the player's progress, or make the puzzle harder to accomplish if they interact with it.
## VII. Screenshots
  The game is planned to have an environment with the same style as Monument Valley, with similar interactable components.

  The concept of this idea is inspired by simple puzzle games I have played in the past.
